# Plastic Free Beach

The Plastic Free Beach project is a community that is concerned about the plastic pollution in beaches in Den Haag, Netherlands. The beaches of Scheveninger are highly visited by tourists from all over The Netherlands and other neighbor countries. Along the coast there are a large number of beach bars and food kiosks where, especially during the summer. So keeping the beach clean is good not only for the environment, but also to keep the beauty and a nice place for the tourist.

The project was made just to gather people interested in keeping the beach clean and also to do our part in trying to lower our impact on Earth. Plastic Free Beach will be an essential tool to spread the idea and to organize meetings and the clean up activities. With a Sign up system that will allow the owner knows who is interested and the email for more contacts.

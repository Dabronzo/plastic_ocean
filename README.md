# Know Bugs

- During all the tests and development of this project one bug was noted and couldn't be fixed.
When the page is loaded for the first time the background pictures are taking a bit longer to load, this cause a fast and weird looking stage where the animation effect is not so appealing. This might be due to the size of the pictures or the way that is being loaded in the server. I've tried to use the smallest size possible (to not be pixelated) and the time of loading was reduced but still visible.
However this effect only happens one time, when the page is loaded for the first time, once the page data is in cache the loading time is almost zero and the bug doesn't happen.

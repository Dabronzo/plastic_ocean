# Plastic Free Ocean

The Plastic Free Ocean project is a community that is concerned about the plastic pollution in beaches in Den Haag, Netherlands. The beaches of Scheveninger are highly visited by tourists from all over The Netherlands and other neighbor countries. Along the coast there are a large number of beach bars and food kiosks where, especially during the summer. So keeping the beach clean is good not only for the environment, but also to keep the beauty and a nice place for the tourist.The project was made just to gather people interested in keeping the beach clean and also to do our part in trying to lower our impact on Earth.

# Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub web pages. Link: [Plastic Free Ocean](https://dabronzo.github.io/plastic_ocean/index.html)

# User Experience

## Strategy

The main goal of the project is to inspire more people to join the project, making the **Plastic Free Ocean** grown to have more impact on the local community. 

### B2C
 The main focus is to bring a better user experience and an intuitive navigation. The website displays pictures and information to highlight the plastic pollution problem and bring solutions that can be accessible to everyone. Due to the nature of the project the B2C has more emphasis on the development. Most of the pictures are in a big scale and have a good quality, causing an emotional trigger and aiming at higher engagement with the users. 

### B2B
As an important part of the goals in this project is some tool that allows the owner/organization of the **Plastic Free Ocean** in gathering some data for the members, with this in mind a form was created to collect the data such as name, email and options of events to attend. The most important information is the members email, allowing the organization to send information about the project and announce new events. The user can also enter some information about which events want to participate. 

## Scope

The website is developed to have a very simple and intuitive interface, allowing both first time users and regular users to navigate and find information about the project and its activities. It consists of three pages: **Home**, as the landing page, where
partial information about the project is displayed. Additionally, you can find activities calendar and contact information there. **Plastic and Pollution** is a gallery page, created to highlight the problem of plastic in the ocean and inspire people to take small actions to mitigate it. **Sign Up** is a page for the user to sign up and participate in the project. It also serves the organisation of the project by keeping a database of all members.

## Structure

To keep the project consistent and intuitive The navigation bar remains the same through the pages to keep the project consistent and intuitive. Hover animations on the links which provide a more instinctive behaviour and visual sensation(information) to the user.
The user can navigate through the pages also with links on texts along the page, so if the user is reading about joining the program on the main page the **Join** is highlighted and works as a link the sign-up page.


## Skeleton

The project has a few simple features due to its own nature: pictures, animations, text information and a sign up form. The navbar and the footer are consistent and repeat along the pages.

Below is a wireframe model of the project made with **Balsamic Wireframes**. The final project turned out to be a bit different.

## Surface

Simple colours based shades of blue and white were used in the design, giving a good contrast between the headers, paragraphs and the links. The navigation bar reacts to users’ location within the page by creating a different background mark, reminding the user where he is. The spacing between the letters in the text makes it easier to read.

# Responsive

The website is designed to be totally responsive, working on computers, tablets and smartphones. Bellow is the responsive visualisation:

# Features
## 1 Navigation Bar
- It features three links which redirect to the other parts of the site. “Home”, "Plastic and Tourism" are the sections of the main site, while the "Sign Up" brings the user to the page with the form.
- When the user hovers over the links, the background and the colour of the text changes to give the user a more clear idea about which of the links the user is on.
- The bar is fully responsive, the logo and the menu links adjust to smaller screens by changing the layout. Additionally, when the user is on the "Sign Up" page, its link gets a different colour, showing which page the user is currently on.

## 2 The Landing Image
- It includes a photograph of a turtle with a blue shade gradient which gets more opaque by the bottom of the picture and an overlay text with a catching phrase.
- The overlay text has an animation where the sentences appear at different timings.

## 4 Activities
- The layout shows three "cards" here, each one holding information about the time, location and the type of activities that will be hosted by the project.
- The responsive behaviour for the smaller screen will change cards layout from horizontal to vertical, making the content more user friendly.

# Know Bugs

- During all the tests and development of this project one bug was noted and couldn't be fixed.
When the page is loaded for the first time the background pictures are taking a bit longer to load, this cause a fast and weird looking stage where the animation effect is not so appealing. This might be due to the size of the pictures or the way that is being loaded in the server. I've tried to use the smallest size possible (to not be pixelated) and the time of loading was reduced but still visible.
However this effect only happens one time, when the page is loaded for the first time, once the page data is in cache the loading time is almost zero and the bug doesn't happen.
